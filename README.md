# Multipart Library

In Android development, "multipart" typically refers to multipart HTTP requests, which are used for uploading files and form data to a server in a single HTTP request. This is especially useful for applications that need to send both files (like images, videos, or documents) and regular form fields (like text fields) together.




## Documentation


### How Multipart Requests Work
A multipart request is composed of multiple parts, each containing a different piece of data, which could be a file, a form field, or other content. Each part has its own headers and body, allowing for a complex structure of data to be sent efficiently.

### Key Concepts Boundary: 
A unique string used to separate different parts of the multipart message.
Content-Disposition: A header that specifies the nature of the content in the part (e.g., form-data, file).
Content-Type: A header that indicates the type of data in the part (e.g., text/plain, image/jpeg).

### Common Use Cases
Uploading images or videos from a mobile app to a server.
Sending a form submission with both text and file inputs.
Posting data to RESTful APIs that require file uploads.
