# Multipart Library

In Android development, "multipart" typically refers to multipart HTTP requests, which are used for uploading files and form data to a server in a single HTTP request. This is especially useful for applications that need to send both files (like images, videos, or documents) and regular form fields (like text fields) together.




## Documentation


### How Multipart Requests Work
A multipart request is composed of multiple parts, each containing a different piece of data, which could be a file, a form field, or other content. Each part has its own headers and body, allowing for a complex structure of data to be sent efficiently.

### Key Concepts Boundary: 
A unique string used to separate different parts of the multipart message.
Content-Disposition: A header that specifies the nature of the content in the part (e.g., form-data, file).
Content-Type: A header that indicates the type of data in the part (e.g., text/plain, image/jpeg).

### Common Use Cases
Uploading images or videos from a mobile app to a server.
Sending a form submission with both text and file inputs.
Posting data to RESTful APIs that require file uploads.

## Deployment

How to
To get a Git project into your build:

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

gradle
maven
sbt
leiningen
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

	dependencyResolutionManagement {
		repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
		repositories {
			mavenCentral()
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
Step 2. Add the dependency

	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.nayanapetkar2024:multipartlibrary:1.5'
